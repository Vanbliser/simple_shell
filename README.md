# simple_shell
**Compilation**
Your shell will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

**Checks**
The Checker will be released at the end of the project (1-2 days before the deadline). We strongly encourage the entire class to work together to create a suite of checks covering both regular tests and edge cases for each task. See task 8. Test suite.

**TASKS**
**0. Betty would be proud**

Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks

**1. Simple shell 0.1**

Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

Usage: simple_shell

Your Shell should:

Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.

The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.

The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.

The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.

If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.

Handle errors.

You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)

You don’t have to:

use the PATH

implement built-ins

handle special characters : ", ', `, , *, &, #

be able to move the cursor

handle commands with arguments

execve will be the core part of your Shell, don’t forget to pass the environ to it…
**
**2. Simple shell 0.2**

Simple shell 0.1 +

Handle command lines with arguments

**3. Simple shell 0.3**

Simple shell 0.2 +

Handle the PATH

fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist
**
4. Simple shell 0.4**

Simple shell 0.3 +

Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell

Usage: exit

You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit

**5. Simple shell 1.0**

Simple shell 0.4 +

Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment

**6. Simple shell 0.1.1**

Simple shell 0.1 +

Write your own getline function

Use a buffer to read many chars at once and call the least possible the read system call

You will need to use static variables●

You are not allowed to use getline

You don’t have to:

be able to move the cursor

**7. Simple shell 0.2.1**

Simple shell 0.2 +

You are not allowed to use strtok

**8. Simple shell 0.4.1**

Simple shell 0.4 +

handle arguments for the built-in exit

Usage: exit status, where status is an integer used to exit the shell

**9. setenv, unsetenv**

Simple shell 1.0 +

Implement the setenv and unsetenv builtin commands setenv

Initialize a new environment variable, or modify an existing one

Command syntax: setenv VARIABLE VALUE

Should print something on stderr on failure unsetenv

Remove an environment variable

Command syntax: unsetenv VARIABLE

Should print something on stderr on failure

**10. cd**

Simple shell 1.0 +

Implement the builtin command cd:

Changes the current directory of the process.

Command syntax: cd [DIRECTORY]

If no argument is given to cd the command must be interpreted like cd $HOME

You have to handle the command cd -

You have to update the environment variable PWD when you change directory

man chdir, man getcwd11. ;

**11. ;**

Simple shell 1.0 +

Handle the commands separator ;
**
**12. && and ||**

Simple shell 1.0 +

Handle the && and || shell logical operators

**13. alias**

Simple shell 1.0 +

Implement the alias builtin command

Usage: alias [name[='value'] ...]

alias: Prints a list of all aliases, one per line, in the form name='value'

alias name [name2 ...]: Prints the aliases name, name2, etc 1 per line, in the form name='value'

alias name='value' [...]: Defines an alias for each name whose value is given. If name is

already an alias, replaces its value with value

**14. Variables**

Simple shell 1.0 +

Handle variables replacement

Handle the $? variable

Handle the $$ variable

**15. Comments**

Simple shell 1.0 +

Handle comments (#)

**16. File as input**

Simple shell 1.0 +

Usage: simple_shell [filename]●

Your shell can take a file as a command line argument

The file contains all the commands that your shell should run before exiting

The file should contain one command per line

In this mode, the shell should not print a prompt and should not read from stdin
